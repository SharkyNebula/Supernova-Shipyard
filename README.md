This mod brings Escape Velocity ship graphics to the next level with boosted ship sizes, as well as unique shields, engine glows, running lights, visually appropriate weapon exit points, and weapon glows for every ship.

[Nexusmods Page](https://www.nexusmods.com/escapevelocitynova/mods/5). 

### What this _is_:

A total conversion for viewing new graphics and seeing NPC ships fight with them. There are 224 ships in total. 76 are unique. 148 are factional variants.

### What this _isn't_:

A plug-in for the base EV Nova scenario. If you place these plug-ins into your Nova Plug-ins folder, overwriting the base scenario, things **WILL** look funky.

A total conversion that remakes the EV Nova universe while including the Supernova Shipyard designs. If you want that, wait for EVN: Triskelion.

### System requirements:

Base: 0.65GB of RAM.
Animated Hyperioids: +0.2GB of RAM.
Fitted shields: +0.45GB of RAM.
Total: 1.3GB of RAM.

### How to install (Windows): 

1) Copy and Paste your EV Nova folder.
1) Delete the Nova Files and Plug-ins folders in the duplicated folder.
1) Extract the Supernova Shipyard archive and place the contents (replacement Nova Files and Plug-ins folders) in your duplicated EV Nova folder.

### Important note about WinNova memory limits:

**Windows EV Nova can only load about 1GB of assets** into memory before it will refuse to load. The fitted shields (400MB) and animated Hyperioids (180MB) have been excised from the Nova Files folder so the game can run on Windows. Please ensure the total number of files that your WinNova has to load is below 1GB, or test it on MacNova instead. **MacNova can load up to 4GB.** [Or wait for Cosmic Frontier, which loads files in a smarter way.](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cosmicfrontier/cosmic-frontier-override)

### Where do I find the ships:

* You can find **Federation** ships fighting in the **Clementine** system. This is the system you start in.
* **Auroran** ships, **Tangerine** system.
* **Polaris** ships, **Orange** system.
* **Wild Geese** ships, **Grapefruit** system.
* **Escape Velocity** ships, **Dekopon** system.
* **United Earth** ships, **Lemon** system.
* **Crescent** ships (none yet!), **Lime** system.

### Can I make a EV Nova graphics mod with this?

You certainly can. All of the Nova ships or reimagined analogues are present here.

### I want technical info!

You can find it here, as a Spreadsheet on Google Sheets: [Supernova Shipyard info.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11uJtZSP5wY4b6OLVUfjmHOF7JlvfjJez6DbdDmBfz-U/)

That spreadsheet contains the following sheets:

* ID Order: a technical listing of which rleDs, descs and picture IDs are assigned to which ship
* Dudes: which dudes are assigned to what system and what govt has which ID and tech level
* Render Info: the sizes that ships and their effects should be rendered at, as well as how their gaussian blurs should be colored
* Frame Count: the frame counts for animated ships
* Faction Colors: the hex codes for faction colors
* Sizes Stats: the placeholder stats I assigned to ship size categories
* Width/Length: a sheet for deriving the lore width, length and height of each ship

### I want to view the 3D models.
You can view the 3D models at [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/NebulaTank/collections).

### I want to 3D print the 3D models.
You can download the 3D models at [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/NebulaTank/collections) for 3D printing. The only thing in those files are the ships themselves.

### I want the Novalike camera angles for rendering.
You can find them at [GitHub](https://github.com/NebulaTank/Supernova-Shipyard-Source). Here's the [Ship Template](https://github.com/NebulaTank/Supernova-Shipyard-Source/blob/main/Blends-%20Ships/Ship%20Template.blend).

### I want to view a gallery of the shipyard info images.

You can find such a gallery at [Deviantart](https://www.deviantart.com/nebulatank/gallery/75126808/spaceship-showcases).
